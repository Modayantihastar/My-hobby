    <p >My Hobby is playing an instrument, the instrument I play is called a violin. The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone in the violin family. I like the sounds of all strings on the violin.  It makes me feel happy and want to play it everyday. I started playing violin when I was 11 years old. I could see that I have improved my violin skills in 6 months. </p>
      
<p>Learning to play the violin improves your co-ordination skills and play new songs. Violin  produces great and loud sound. These are the reasons why I like to play the violin.
